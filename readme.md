# Godot Support for Rider

The "Godot Support" plugin adds specific functionality for the [Godot game engine](https://godotengine.org/) Mono version (C# support) to [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).

Rider is JetBrains' cross platform .NET IDE, based on ReSharper and the IntelliJ Platform. It can be used on Windows, Mac and Linux providing rich code navigation, inspections and refactorings.

 - `Attach` to debug already started player
 - `WATSharp` to start the test-runner. [More](https://www.reddit.com/r/godot/comments/jl547k/official_jetbrains_godot_support_plugin_for_rider/)
