<p>Highlights lines where leading indentation does not match the configured Code Style (tabs vs spaces) in GDScript files.</p>

<p>
  The inspection scans only the leading whitespace at the start of each line and reports:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Tabs found when spaces are expected.</li>
  <li>Spaces found when tabs are expected.</li>
</ul>

<p>
  Use the quick fix <b>Convert Indents</b> to convert leading indentation across the file to the desired style.
