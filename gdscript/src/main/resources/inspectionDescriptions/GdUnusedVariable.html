<p>Reports GDScript variables and constants that are declared but never used.</p>

<p>
This inspection helps keep your scripts clean by detecting local variables and const declarations that have no usages in the project scope. If a type hint is present but refers to an unresolved type, the declaration is ignored to prevent false positives.
</p>

<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code>
var tmp = 42 # unused, will be reported
const PI2 = PI * 2 # unused, will be reported

var enemy: UnknownType # ignored if UnknownType cannot be resolved
</code></pre>

<p>Quick fix actions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Remove the unused variable/constant.</li>
</ul>

<p>The inspection does not report declarations that are referenced anywhere in the project. It also skips declarations with unresolved type to avoid false alarms.</p>
