#brief Class for displaying popups with a panel background.
#desc Class for displaying popups with a panel background. In some cases it might be simpler to use than [Popup], since it provides a configurable background. If you are making windows, better check [Window].
#desc If any [Control] node is added as a child of this [PopupPanel], it will be stretched to fit the panel's size (similar to how [PanelContainer] works).
