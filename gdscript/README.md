GdScript2 language plugin for JetBrains IDEs (Intellij, Rider, and all the other ones)  
Supports only Godot 4.0 and higher

## History

This plugin was originally developed by David ([@IceExplosive](https://gitlab.com/IceExplosive)) and was available on
GitLab and the JetBrains Marketplace. When the original author could no longer maintain the project, JetBrains took over
its development to ensure continued support for the Godot community. We're grateful for David's work that laid
the foundation for this plugin.
